# CODSOFT Java Internship Projects

This repository contains all the projects completed as part of the **Java Development Internship** at CODSOFT. The projects focus on core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, and practical problem-solving.

## üìå **Projects Included**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Guessing Game (Number Game)
- Generates a random number within a specified range.
- User inputs guesses, and feedback is provided on correctness.
- Features include limited attempts, multiple rounds, and score tracking.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Student Management System
